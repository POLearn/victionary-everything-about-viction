# Interaction with a Smart Contract

### Introduction

In this final section of deploying your first contract, let's learn how to interact with your deployed contract by using the setter method to update the name variable üîß

> Prerequisite: Ensure you have MetaMask installed and connected to the Open Campus Codex network, and your SimpleContract is successfully deployed.

### Interacting with the Contract

Now that your SimpleContract is deployed on the Open Campus Codex network, let's change the name variable to `Vitalik` using the set method and retrieve the transaction hash to verify the transaction.

#### Call the set Method

First, locate the set function in your contract interface. In the input field, type **Vitalik** and click "Transact." MetaMask will prompt you to confirm the transaction‚Äîapprove it and wait for the transaction to be processed.

#### Verify the Contract's State

Once the transaction is confirmed, call the name function in your contract to check its current value. If it returns Vitalik, congratulations! You've successfully interacted with your contract and updated its state. üéâ

### ‚ùóSubmit the Transaction to Proof of Learn

To validate this thequest, submit the transaction hash to the Proof of Learn (POL) platform. This confirms that you've successfully interacted with the smart contract.
