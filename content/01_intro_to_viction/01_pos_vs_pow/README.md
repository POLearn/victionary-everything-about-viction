## ‚ö°Background 

In the blockchain world, **Bitcoin** uses **Proof of Work (PoW)**, while **Ethereum** has shifted to **Proof of Stake (PoS)**. 

In **PoW**, nodes compete to solve complex problems, requiring substantial computational power. This can lead to forks, where multiple blocks are created at the same height, causing uncertainty about which block is valid. The "Longest Chain Wins" rule eventually resolves this, but transactions remain probabilistic until additional blocks confirm their validity.

Conversely, **PoS** selects block-generating nodes based on their staked cryptocurrency, reducing the likelihood of forks and enhancing efficiency. However, it can still face finality issues without sufficient consensus among nodes.

This uncertainty impacts user experiences, particularly in financial transactions. For instance, a user might have to wait 30 to 60 minutes for a transfer to be confirmed, as the service needs to ensure the transaction is irreversible after potential forks are resolved. 

Ultimately, both consensus mechanisms offer unique benefits and challenges, but guaranteed finality is a crucial factor for improving blockchain usability.

## Consensus Mechanism

**Viction** employs a unique **_Proof-of-Stake Voting (PoSV)_** consensus mechanism that combines robust security features with high transaction efficiency. The consensus process is designed to ensure fairness and reliability while maintaining decentralization. Here‚Äôs how it works:

1. **üõ†Ô∏è Masternode Participation**: Viction operates a network of **150 Masternodes**, where token holders can stake a minimum of **50,000 VIC** tokens to become **Masternode candidates**.

2. **üó≥Ô∏è Voting and Selection**: Token holders actively participate in the governance process by voting for **Masternode candidates**. The candidates receiving the most votes are elected as **Masternodes**.

3. **üîÑ Block Creation and Double Validation**: Once elected, Masternodes take turns generating blocks in a **round-robin** manner. To enhance security, each block creation is verified by another randomly selected Masternode through a process called **_double validation_**.

4. **‚ö° Rapid Finality**: This innovative consensus mechanism allows Viction to achieve impressive performance, processing up to **2,000 transactions per second (TPS)** with a **block confirmation time** of just **2 seconds**.

The **PoSV** consensus algorithm not only optimizes transaction throughput but also reinforces the network‚Äôs security, making **Viction** a reliable platform for decentralized applications and Web3 projects. 

### Enhanced Security and Scalability

By leveraging double validation, Viction addresses common challenges faced by traditional proof-of-stake systems, such as potential collusion and nothing-at-stake attacks. This innovative approach ensures a high level of trust within the network, fostering a secure environment for users and developers alike. With Viction's ability to scale efficiently while maintaining security, the platform is well-equipped to support a wide array of applications, from finance to gaming and beyond. As more developers and projects join the Viction ecosystem, the network's potential for growth and innovation continues to expand, paving the way for the future of decentralized technology.
