## VRC25

The VRC25 standard introduces a game-changing feature: gasless transactions. This means users no longer need native tokens for transaction fees; instead, they can use VRC25 tokens, simplifying the process and making it more user-friendly, especially for newcomers to the blockchain. A key highlight is that VRC25 allows smart contracts to sponsor transaction fees, enhancing their functionality and demonstrating Viction's focus on user-centric solutions. While retaining the familiar ERC20 structure for compatibility, VRC25 improves the user experience by streamlining token transfers and fee management, making blockchain more accessible and https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solide-project/awesome-learn-solidity/vic for everyone.

## Comparison between VRC25/ERC20 

*For the official overview of the VRC25 specification, take a look at Viction's VRC25 Documentation: [VRC25 Specification](https://docs.viction.xyz/developer-guide/standards-and-specification/vrc25-specification).*

Let's take a look at the specification by examining the `contracts/interfaces/IVRC25.sol` file:

```solidity
interface IVRC25 {
    event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value);
    event Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint256 value);
    event Fee(address indexed from, address indexed to, address indexed issuer, uint256 value);

    function decimals() external view returns (uint8);
    function totalSupply() external view returns (uint256);
    function balanceOf(address owner) external view returns (uint256);
    function issuer() external view returns (address);
    function allowance(address owner, address spender) external view returns (uint256);
    function estimateFee(uint256 value) external view returns (uint256);
    function transfer(address recipient, uint256 value) external returns (bool);
    function approve(address spender, uint256 value) external returns (bool);
    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 value) external returns (bool);
}
```

When comparing this to a simplified `ERC20.sol` interface, you'll notice that the methods are largely similar:

```solidity
interface IERC20 { 
    function totalSupply() external view returns (uint256); 
    function balanceOf(address account) external view returns (uint256); 
    function transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
    function allowance(address owner, address spender) external view returns (uint256); 
    function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
    function transferFrom(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount) external returns (bool); 
}
```

The `IVRC25` interface presents a structure that's instantly recognizable to anyone familiar with ERC20. It includes functions like `totalSupply`, `balanceOf`, `transfer`, `allowance`, `approve`, and `transferFrom`, preserving the core capabilities that guarantee compatibility and simplicity of integration. These functions enable fundamental token operations such as checking balances, transferring tokens, and managing allowances, ensuring that all essential functionalities for token management are well-supported.
