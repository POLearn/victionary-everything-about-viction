## Quest - Gasless Burn

In this final segment, we’ll experience the Zero Gas Protocol through a gasless minting transaction. By now, you should have minted `100000000000000000000` tokens of your VRC25 token to **Address Y**. Let’s replicate this process, but with a this time, the transaction should incur no gas fees, thanks to the VicIssuer integration.

Load your VRC25 token into your wallet or IDE, then use **Address Y** to mint `100000000000000000000` tokens again. Unlike before, this action no longer requires gas fees, thanks to the VicIssuer integration, which enables gasless minting, burning, and transferring of tokens.

After completing the minting, retrieve the transaction hash and review the details in the blockchain explorer. Here's an example of a gasless transaction:

In the explorer, note the transaction type: **Gas Sponsored**.

After the transaction, check the wallet balance or view the address on the explorer. The VIC balance should remain untouched, confirming that no gas fees were deducted for this action.
