## `issuer`

The `issuer` function verifies the address of the token issuer, ensuring only the designated issuer can manage transaction fees. This adds a layer of security and accountability, maintaining the token's integrity.

```solidity
function issuer() external view returns (address);
```

### `estimateFee`

The `estimateFee` function calculates the transaction fee in VRC25 tokens, which is payable to the token issuer. This function allows for customized fee structures, enhancing flexibility for issuers.

```solidity
function estimateFee(uint256 value) external view returns (uint256);
```

By leveraging `estimateFee`, user wallets can inform users about transaction costs, improving financial planning and transparency. This integration makes VRC25 more user-friendly, allowing better management of transaction fees within the blockchain ecosystem.
